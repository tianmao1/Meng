I have learnt some basic HTML syntaxes. 
Reading all the material and following the instructions make the quizz and project easier to solve.
Be familiar with the syntax takes some time and is a bit difficult at first.
I googled for HTML functions and tested my code frequently help me to accomplish the project.
